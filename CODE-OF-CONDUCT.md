# Code of Conduct:

While we want everyone to contribute freely to our code, we also must ensure that we have a safe and open environment for everyone to contribute our code.
For a productive work environment, there shall not be any intolerance under the following policies:

- All code must not have any comments that can be seen as derogatory and/or hurtful towards either the original contributor or other contributors.
- Comments should be used to explain parts of the code, or give insight to why you wrote the code the way you did.
- If multiple people worked on the forked repo you worked on, please list them in your Pull Request
- In your Pull Requests, please also state what changes you made and why.
- If you have a problem with any other contributors, please direct issues towards the repo owner (Alejandro Ciuba)
- If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please email the main contributors

We hope that these rules allow everyone a safe and friendly environment for contributing to the project.
