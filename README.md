## Contributions:
If you wish to contribute, please fork this directory and make any changes and/or replacements to our code as you wish. Afterwards, please submit a Pull Request and the repo owner (Alejandro) will get back to you as soon as possible. If any changes to the code need to be discussed or removed from the Pull Request, we will send a detailed comment explaining why those things cannot be changed or how to change them to better fit the project's specifications. Thank you for your time.

## License and Code of Conduct:
We chose the MIT License because we wanted to give anyone who accessed our repo full rights to do whatever they want with their forked repos. As well as make any changes they want to submit to the main repo without the hassling of copyright. We also made our Code of Conduct very lenient to allow for as much room for change as possible as the project is very small and we want to encourage others to help us. We believe these two things would make our project very fun and enjoyable to work on while allowing us some control over what gets added to the main project repo and thus, the main product.
